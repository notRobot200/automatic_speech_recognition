# automatic_speech_recognition

## 📌 Overview:

- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a system that converts spoken language into text using machine learning models. This project implements ASR using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Converts speech to text with high accuracy

- Supports multiple audio formats (WAV, MP3, etc.)

- Uses pre-trained deep learning models for transcription

- Works on multi-language 

## 📚 Model Used:

This project leverages Whisper by OpenAI, a powerful ASR model known for its robustness across various languages and accents.
