# automatic_speech_recognition

## 📌 Overview:

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a system that converts spoken language into text using machine learning models. This project implements ASR using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## ✨ Features:

- Converts speech to text with high accuracy

- Supports multiple audio formats (WAV, MP3, etc.)

- Uses pre-trained deep learning models for transcription

- Supports multiple languages 

## 📚 Model Used:

This project leverages Whisper by OpenAI, a powerful ASR model known for its robustness across various languages and accents.

## 🔧 Deployment:

This application is deployed on Streamlit, a Python-based framework for building interactive web applications.
